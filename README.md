### Troubleshooting

1. Conflicts when installing `XCode Command Line Tools` on Mac:

    Run from the console - this command will install the XCode IDE + Command Line Tools (which works if you have enough space on your Mac):
    ```
    $ xcode-select â€“install
    ```
   
    Another alternative is to simply download and install the version of `Command Line Tools` that we need: this can be done manually from the [Apple Developer Portal / More Downloads] (https://developer.apple.com/download/all/? q = xcode).
